What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
CSS Demo - One HTML Page - Multiple Styles!
Here we will show one HTML page displayed with four different stylesheets. 
Click on the "Stylesheet 1", "Stylesheet 2", "Stylesheet 3", "Stylesheet 4"

CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

When tags like &lt;font&gt;, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, 
it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, 
where fonts and color information were added to every single page, 
became a long and expensive process.

To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium  created CSS.

CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!


Example Explained
p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: &lt;p&gt;).
color is a property, and red is the property value
text-align is a property, and center is the property value

CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

The CSS element Selector
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

Example
Here, all &lt;p&gt; elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

Example
The CSS rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1": 

#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
Note: An id name cannot start with a number!


The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

Example
In this example all HTML elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

Example
In this example only &lt;p&gt; elements with class="center" will be red and center-aligned: 

p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

Example
In this example the &lt;p&gt; element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": 

&lt;p class="center large"&gt;This paragraph refers to two classes.&lt;/p&gt;
Note: A class name cannot start with a number!

The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

Example
The CSS rule below will affect every HTML element on the page: 

* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

h2 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Example
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: 

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}


Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS
External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing 
just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside 
the &lt;link&gt; element, inside the head section.

Example
External styles are defined within the &lt;link&gt; element, inside the &lt;head&gt; 
section of an HTML page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a 
.css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.

Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:

"mystyle.css"
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
Note: Do not add a space between the property value (20) and the unit (px):
Incorrect (space): margin-left: 20 px;
Correct (no space): margin-left: 20px;

Internal CSS
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the head section.

Example
Internal styles are defined within the &lt;style&gt; element, inside the &lt;head&gt; 
section of an HTML page:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
body {
  background-color: linen;
}

h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. 
The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Example
Inline styles are defined within the "style" attribute of the relevant element:

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;"&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet 
(by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.

Multiple Style Sheets
If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) 
in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

Assume that an external style sheet has the following style for the &lt;h1&gt; element:

h1 {
  color: navy;
}
Then, assume that an internal style sheet also has the following style 
for the &lt;h1&gt; element:

h1 {
  color: orange;   
}
Example
If the internal style is defined after the link to the external style sheet, 
the &lt;h1&gt; elements will be "orange":

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
Example
However, if the internal style is defined before the link to the external style sheet, 
the &lt;h1&gt; elements will be "navy": 

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
h1 {
  color: orange;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
Cascading Order
What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the 
following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

Inline style (inside an HTML element)
External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
Browser default
So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and 
internal styles and browser defaults.

CSS Text Color
You can set the color of text:

Hello World
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh 
euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

Ut wisi enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exerci tation ullamcorper suscipit 
lobortis nisl ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Example
&lt;h1 style="color:Tomato;"&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style="color:DodgerBlue;"&gt;Lorem ipsum...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"&gt;Ut wisi enim...&lt;/p&gt;


The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.

In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-attachment
background-position
background (shorthand property)
CSS background-color
The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.

Example
The background color of a page is set like this:

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
With CSS, a color is most often specified by:

a valid color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

Other Elements
You can set the background color for any HTML elements:

Example
Here, the &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, and &lt;div&gt; elements will have different 
background colors: 

h1 {
  background-color: green;
}

div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Opacity / Transparency
The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element. 
It can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0.


CSS Border Style
The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display.

The following values are allowed:

dotted - Defines a dotted border
dashed - Defines a dashed border
solid - Defines a solid border
double - Defines a double border
groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
none - Defines no border
hidden - Defines a hidden border
The border-style property can have from one to four values 
(for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).

CSS Margins
The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, 
outside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the margins. There are properties for 
setting the margin for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

Margin - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the margin for each side of an element:

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left
All the margin properties can have the following values:

auto - the browser calculates the margin
length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element
Tip: Negative values are allowed.

Example
Set different margins for all four sides of a &lt;p&gt; element:

p {
  margin-top: 100px;
  margin-bottom: 100px;
  margin-right: 150px;
  margin-left: 80px;
}


CSS Padding
The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, 
inside of any defined borders.

With CSS, you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting 
the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left).

Padding - Individual Sides
CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element:

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
All the padding properties can have the following values:

length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.
% - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element
inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element
Note: Negative values are not allowed.

Example
Set different padding for all four sides of a &lt;div&gt; element:  

div {
  padding-top: 50px;
  padding-right: 30px;
  padding-bottom: 50px;
  padding-left: 80px;
}
The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

This element has a height of 50 pixels and a width of 100%.

CSS Setting height and width
The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. 
It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

CSS height and width Values
The height and width properties may have the following values:

auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
% - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value
CSS height and width Examples
This element has a height of 200 pixels and a width of 50%
Example
Set the height and width of a &lt;div&gt; element:

div {
  height: 200px;
  width: 50%;
  background-color: powderblue;
}

This element has a height of 100 pixels and a width of 500 pixels.
Example
Set the height and width of another &lt;div&gt; element:

div {
  height: 100px;
  width: 500px;
  background-color: powderblue;
}

The CSS Box Model
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 


Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 

CSS has the following outline properties:

outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline

Text Color
The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is specified by:

a color name - like "red"
a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Look at CSS Color Values for a complete list of possible color values.

The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.

Font Selection is Important
Choosing the right font has a huge impact on how the readers experience a website.

The right font can create a strong identity for your brand.

Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. 
It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.

Generic Font Families
In CSS there are five generic font families:

Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. 
They create a sense of formality and elegance.
Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). 
They create a modern and minimalistic look.
Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. 
They create a mechanical look. 
Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families. 

How To Add Icons
The simplest way to add an icon to your HTML page, is with an icon library, 
such as Font Awesome.

Add the name of the specified icon class to any inline HTML element 
(like &lt;i&gt; or &lt;span&gt;).

All the icons in the icon libraries below, are scalable vectors that can be 
customized with CSS (size, color, shadow, etc.)

Font Awesome Icons
To use the Font Awesome icons, go to fontawesome.com, sign in, and get a 
code to add in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML page:

&lt;script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/yourcode.js" 
crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Read more about how to get started with Font Awesome in our Font Awesome 5 tutorial.

Note: No downloading or installation is required!

In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in.

The four links states are:

a:link - a normal, unvisited link
a:visited - a link the user has visited
a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
a:active - a link the moment it is clicked

HTML Lists and CSS List Properties
In HTML, there are two main types of lists:

unordered lists (&lt;ul&gt;) - the list items are marked with bullets
ordered lists (&lt;ol&gt;) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
The CSS list properties allow you to:

Set different list item markers for ordered lists
Set different list item markers for unordered lists
Set an image as the list item marker
Add background colors to lists and list items
Different List Item Markers
The list-style-type property specifies the type of list item marker.


Table Borders
To specify table borders in CSS, use the border property.

The example below specifies a solid border for &lt;table&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, and 
&lt;td&gt; elements:

The display Property
The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.

Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. 
The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The &lt;div&gt; element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
&lt;header&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline &lt;span&gt; element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

&lt;span&gt;
&lt;a&gt;
&lt;img&gt;
Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting 
and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know 
how this can be achieved.

The &lt;script&gt; element uses display: none; as default. 

Override The Default Display Value
As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.

Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, 
can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.

A common example is making inline &lt;li&gt; elements for horizontal menus:

Example
li {
  display: inline;
}
Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, 
NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; 
is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.

Using width, max-width and margin: auto;
As mentioned in the previous chapter; a block-level element always takes up the 
full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to 
the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally 
center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, 
and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins:

This &lt;div&gt; element has a width of 500px, and margin set to auto.

Note: The problem with the &lt;div&gt; above occurs when the browser window is 
smaller than the width of the element. The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling 
of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on small devices:

This &lt;div&gt; element has a max-width of 500px, and margin set to auto.

Tip: Resize the browser window to less than 500px wide, to see the difference 
between the two divs!

Here is an example of the two divs above:

Example
div.ex1 {
  width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

div.ex2 {
  max-width: 500px;
  margin: auto;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element 
(static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).

The position Property
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky
Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. 
However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. 
They also work differently depending on the position value.

position: static;
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; 
it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:

This &lt;div&gt; element has position: static;
Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned 
element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content 
will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

This &lt;div&gt; element has position: relative;
Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  left: 30px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

position: fixed;
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, 
which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. 
The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.

A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page. Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.fixed {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 300px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
This &lt;div&gt; element has position: fixed;
position: absolute;
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, 
it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.

Here is a simple example:

This &lt;div&gt; element has position: relative;This &lt;div&gt; element has position: absolute;
Here is the CSS that is used:

Example
div.relative {
  position: relative;
  width: 400px;
  height: 200px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

div.absolute {
  position: absolute;
  top: 80px;
  right: 0;
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}
position: sticky;
An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.

A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it 
"sticks" in place (like position:fixed).


Note: Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning. Safari requires 
a -webkit- prefix (see example below). You must also specify at least one of 
top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.

In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0), 
when you reach its scroll position.

Example
div.sticky {
  position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: green;
  border: 2px solid #4CAF50;
}

There are tons of different layout designs to choose from. However, 
the structure above, is one of the most common, 
and we will take a closer look at it in this tutorial.

Header
A header is usually located at the top of the website (or right below a top navigation menu). 
It often contains a logo or the website name:

Example
.header {
  background-color: #F1F1F1;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
}
Content
The layout in this section, often depends on the target users. 
The most common layout is one (or combining them) of the following:

1-column (often used for mobile browsers)
2-column (often used for tablets and laptops)
3-column layout (only used for desktops)


CSS Units
CSS has several different units for expressing a length.

Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.

Example
Set different length values, using px (pixels):

h1 {
  font-size: 60px;
}

p {
  font-size: 25px;
  line-height: 50px;
}

Note: A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit. However, 
if the value is 0, the unit can be omitted.

For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed.

There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

Absolute Lengths
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will 
appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, 
because screen sizes vary so much. However, 
they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

Unit	Description
cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)
* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. 
For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. 
For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.

Relative Lengths
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 
Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums.

Unit	Description	
em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch	Relative to width of the "0" (zero)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element	
Tip: The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
* Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide
