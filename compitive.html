                                <code class="comcin">
        C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
-&gt;It is a very popular language, despite being old.
-&gt;C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.
Why Learn C?
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world.If you know C, you will have no problem 
learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar.
C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python.C is very versatile; 
it can be used in both applications and technologies.


Let's create our first C file.
Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File > Save File as):
eg:1 let's print Hello world!
explanation: In order to print any message we need to use a strandard printing function called printf();
Which is already inbuilt in the headerfile #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
here,stdio means strandard input output function whereas .h is the extension for that file...
after mentioning the header file we need to start up by mentioning all the required statements with 
in the main function..declaration is as follows:
int main{
---------
---------
return 0:
}
-This is the declaration of the function ..main is the keyword.....the word "int"
-Is tells us about the return type..return type tells us what a function returns us....by default the return type 
of a main function is "void"
-void means empty....
-After writing the main function we can startup writig our code..
-Inorder to print Hello World!..we don't require any return type..
-So,here is our very first program.....
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void main() {
  printf("Hello World!");
}  
    
To increase the readability we can add comment lines(unreadable lines used to increase redability...)
/ /  single line comment...
    
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void main() {
//let's print hello world
  printf("Hello World!");
}  
in the third line of above program we have added a comment line which dosen't gets executed while
running the program... output of both programs will be the same as:
Hello World!
For mentioning any mutliple lines use the following syntax:
/*---------
------------
------*/
To insert a new line, you can use the \n character
Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.    
In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes


As explained in the Variables chapter, a variable in C must be a specified data type, 
and you must use a format specifier inside the printf() function to display it:

// Create variables
int myNum = 5;             // Integer (whole number)
float myFloatNum = 5.99;   // Floating point number
char myLetter = 'D';       // Character

// Print variables
printf("%d\n", myNum);
printf("%f\n", myFloatNum);
printf("%c\n", myLetter);           
                                </code>

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because 
it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either 1 or 0, which means true (1) or false (0). These values are known as 
Boolean values, and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:


Logical Operators
You can also test for true or false values with logical operators.
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values:
TABLE

Sizeof Operator
The memory size (in bytes) of a data type or a variable can be found with the sizeof operator:

int myInt;
float myFloat;
double myDouble;
char myChar;

printf("%lu\n", sizeof(myInt));
printf("%lu\n", sizeof(myFloat));
printf("%lu\n", sizeof(myDouble));
printf("%lu\n", sizeof(myChar));

Volumes And Areas
1. Square
Area = S²
Perimeter = 4s
s = length of the sides, d = length of diagonal.


2. Rectangle
Area = base x height = b x h
Perimeter = 2 (b + h)

3. Triangle
Area = ½ x base x height
Perimeter = x + y + z ( summation of three sides of a triangle)

4. Rhombus
Area = ½ x product of the diagonals between the sides * sine of the angle between the sides
Perimeter = 4 x side (any side)
Diagonal = 2 x area / diagonal

5. Parallelogram
Area = product of any two sides x sine of the included angle
Perimeter = 2 (a + b) (a and b are the two adjacent sides)

6. Trapezium
Area = ½ * sum of the parallel sides * height.
Volume
The magnitude or capacity of a solid space like a cube, cylinder, etc is known as the volume of that solid.

Different solids and their volumes:

1. Cube
In a cube, length = breadth = height = s
The surface area of a cube = 6s²
The volume of a cube = S³
Diagonal of a cube = √3 s

2. Cuboid
Total surface area of a cuboid: 2 (lb + bh + lh)
The volume of a cuboid: lbh

3. Cylinder
Curved surface area of a cylinder: 2 πrh( r = radius of the base, h = height)
Total surface area of a right circular cylinder = 2 πrh + 2 πr²
The volume of the right circular cylinder: πr²h

4. Cone
Curved surface area of a cone: pirl (l is the slant height)
Total surface area of a cone: πrl + πr²
The volume of a cone: 1/3 πr²h

5. Sphere

Conditions and If Statements
You have already learned that C supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Less than: a &lt; b
Less than or equal to: a &lt;= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

C has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed



Syntax
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}


In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, 
print some text:

Example
if (20 > 18) {
  printf("20 is greater than 18");
}

The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

int time = 20;
if (time &lt; 18) {
  printf("Good day.");
} else {
  printf("Good evening.");
}
// Outputs "Good evening."


The else if Statement
Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}


Switch Statement
Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:

Syntax
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // code block
    break;
  case y:
    // code block
    break;
  default:
    // code block
}

This is how it works:

The switch expression is evaluated once
The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed
The break statement breaks out of the switch block and stops the execution
The default statement is optional, and specifies some code to run if there is no case match
The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

Example
int day = 4;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    printf("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    printf("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    printf("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    printf("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    printf("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    printf("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    printf("Sunday");
    break;
}

// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
                    </code>

Loops
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:

Syntax
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) 
is less than 5:

Example
int i = 0;

while (i &lt; 5) {
  printf("%d\n", i);
  i++;
}


The Do/While Loop
The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, 
before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the 
condition is true.

Syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);


The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, 
even if the condition is false, 
because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

Example
int i = 0;

do {
  printf("%d\n", i);
  i++;
}
while (i &lt; 5);




For Loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, 
use the for loop instead of a while loop:

Syntax
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:

Example
int i;

for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  printf("%d\n", i);
}


Nested Loops
It is also possible to place a loop inside another loop. This is called a nested loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

Example
int i, j;

// Outer loop
for (i = 1; i &lt;= 2; ++i) {
  printf("Outer: %d\n", i);  // Executes 2 times

  // Inner loop
  for (j = 1; j &lt;= 3; ++j) {
    printf(" Inner: %d\n", j);  // Executes 6 times (2 * 3)
  }
}


Break
You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" 
of a switch statement.

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

This example jumps out of the for loop when i is equal to 4:

Example
int i;

for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
  if (i == 4) {
    break;
  }
  printf("%d\n", i);
}

Factorial
In Mathematics, factorial is an important function, which is used to find how many ways things can be arranged 
or the ordered set of numbers. The well known interpolating function of the factorial function was discovered 
by Daniel Bernoulli. The factorial concept is used in many mathematical concepts such as probability, permutations 
and combinations, sequences and series, etc. In short, a factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every 
number below it till 1. For example, the factorial of 3 represents the multiplication of numbers 
3, 2, 1, i.e. 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 and is equal to 6. In this article, you will learn the mathematical definition 
of the factorial, its notation, formula, examples and so on in detail.

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn. 
The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or 
sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.
The Fibonacci numbers were first described in Indian mathematics,as early as 200 BC in work by Pingala on enumerating 
possible patterns of Sanskrit poetry formed from syllables of two lengths. They are named after the Italian mathematician 
Leonardo of Pisa, also known as Fibonacci, 
who introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics in his 1202 book Liber Abaci.

What is Common in Number Pattern Programs?
The common elements in Number Pattern Programs are Conditional Statements.  
We can create patterns by combining Number Patterns with conditional loops and syntax.

Let's look closely at the pattern interpretation of number pattern programs in C.

The first and second groups of the C pattern programme are the conditions for loops and the print statement, 
respectively.

for(condition of the outer loop){
  for(condition of the inner loop){
    print(...);
  }
}
 

Consider the advice given below with a level of caution, as it may not fit every situation.

The loops' conditions can be created as follows:
 

If the number of elements in the rows grows, the outer loop will start at i = 1. Otherwise, it will start at 
i = row or i = n, where n can be any integer.
 
The inner loop will start at j = 1 if the elements in each row are growing. Otherwise, 
it will start at j = row, j = i, or j = n, where n can be any integer.
 

The above approach often works with patterns, but we should constantly cross-check the loop's conditions. In other 
words, to create a number pattern programs in C, consider the following points:
 

Developing number pattern programs in C is simple if you are familiar with loops like the for and while loops.
 
To display number pattern programs in C, most of the time, two nested loops are required.
 
The outer loop determines the number of rows, while the inner loop decides what will go in each row.

What are various Number Pattern Programs in C?
Let's discuss the various Number Pattern Programs in C one by one.

Half Pyramid of Numbers
The user can specify the number of rows to print the half-pyramid of numbers in the following C program, 
and it will show the desired output on the screen.

Code

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() 
{
   int n;
   //User Input
   printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
   scanf("%d",&n);
   
   for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) 
   {
        for (int j = 1; j &lt;= i; ++j) 
        {
            printf("%d ", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
   }
   return 0;
}

 

Output

Enter the number of rows: 6
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 5 6 
Inverted Half Pyramid
This pattern involves an upside-down(inverted) half-pyramid. The idea is the same; however, because the size of 
each row decreases from n to 1, the outer loop moves in the other direction.

Code

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;


int main() 
{
   int n;
   // User Input
   printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
   scanf("%d", &n);
   
   //outer loop moving in the opposite direction
   for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) 
   {
        for (int j = 1; j &lt;= i; ++j) 
        {
            printf("%d ", j);
        }
        printf("\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
 

Output

Enter the number of rows: 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 
1 2 3 4 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 
1 2 
1 
Full Pyramid
There are numerous methods to create a strategy to tackle such a pattern, but let's look at one that is very 
simple. Divide the Full pyramid pattern into two different patterns.

Code

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
  int n;
  printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
  scanf("%d",&n);
  for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
  
    //Pattern 1 starts here
    //first, we print all the blank spaces n-i times
    for (int j = 1; j &lt;= n - i; j++) {
      printf("  ");
    }
    
    //The elements that can be seen in each pattern row and 
    // whose values range from i to 2*i-1 are then printed.
    for (int j = i; j &lt; 2 * i; j++) {
      printf("%d ", j);
    }
    
    //Pattern 2 starts here
    //each row begins with 2*(i-1) and then decremented i - 1 times
    int k = 2 * (i - 1);
    for (int j = 1; j &lt;= i - 1; j++) {
      printf("%d ", k--);
    }
    
   //after completing each row, we print a new line.
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
 

Output

Enter the number of rows: 5
         1 
      2 3 2 
    3 4 5 4 3 
  4 5 6 7 6 5 4 
5 6 7 8 9 8 7 6 5

Strings
Strings are used for storing text/characters.

For example, "Hello World" is a string of characters.

Unlike many other programming languages, C does not have a String type to easily create string variables. 
Instead, you must use the char type and create an array of characters to make a string in C:

char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
Note that you have to use double quotes ("").

To output the string, you can use the printf() function together with the format specifier %s to 
tell C that we are now working with strings:

Example
char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
printf("%s", greetings);
Access Strings
Since strings are actually arrays in C, you can access a string by referring to its index number inside 
square brackets [].

This example prints the first character (0) in greetings:

Example
char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
printf("%c", greetings[0]);
Note that we have to use the %c format specifier to print a single character.

Modify Strings
To change the value of a specific character in a string, refer to the index number, and use single quotes:

Example
char greetings[] = "Hello World!";
greetings[0] = 'J';
printf("%s", greetings);
// Outputs Jello World! instead of Hello World!
Loop Through a String
You can also loop through the characters of a string, using a for loop:

Example
char carName[] = "Volvo";
int i;

for (i = 0; i &gt; 5; ++i) {
  printf("%c\n", carName[i]);
}
Another Way Of Creating Strings
In the examples above, we used a "string literal" to create a string variable. This is the easiest 
way to create a string in C.

You should also note that you can create a string with a set of characters. This example will produce 
the same result as the example in the beginning of this page:

Example
char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
printf("%s", greetings);
Why do we include the \0 character at the end? This is known as the "null terminating character", and must 
be included when creating strings using this method. It tells C that this is the end of the string.

Differences
The difference between the two ways of creating strings, is that the first method is easier to write, 
and you do not have to include the \0 character, as C will do it for you.

You should note that the size of both arrays is the same: They both have 13 characters (space also 
counts as a character by the way), including the \0 character:

Example
char greetings[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '!', '\0'};
char greetings2[] = "Hello World!";

printf("%lu\n", sizeof(greetings));   // Outputs 13
printf("%lu\n", sizeof(greetings2));  // Outputs 13


Strings - Special Characters
Because strings must be written within quotes, C will misunderstand this string, and generate an error:

char txt[] = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.

The backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

Escape character	Result	Description
\'	'	Single quote
\"	"	Double quote
\\	\	Backslash
The sequence \"  inserts a double quote in a string:

Example
char txt[] = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
The sequence \'  inserts a single quote in a string:

Example
char txt[] = "It\'s alright.";
The sequence \\  inserts a single backslash in a string:

Example
char txt[] = "The character \\ is called backslash.";
Other popular escape characters in C are:

Escape Character	Result	
\n	                         New Line	
\t				Tab	
\0				Null	




String Functions
C also has many useful string functions, which can be used to perform certain operations on strings.

To use them, you must include the &lt;string.h&gt; header file in your program:

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
String Length
For example, to get the length of a string, you can use the strlen() function:

Example
char alphabet[] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
printf("%d", strlen(alphabet));
In the Strings chapter, we used sizeof to get the size of a string/array. Note that sizeof and strlen 
behaves differently, as sizeof also includes the \0 character when counting:

Example
char alphabet[] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
printf("%d", strlen(alphabet));   // 26
printf("%d", sizeof(alphabet));   // 27
It is also important that you know that sizeof will always return the memory size (in bytes), 
and not the actual string length:

Example
char alphabet[50] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
printf("%d", strlen(alphabet));   // 26
printf("%d", sizeof(alphabet));   // 50
Concatenate Strings
To concatenate (combine) two strings, you can use the strcat() function:

Example
char str1[20] = "Hello ";
char str2[] = "World!";

// Concatenate str2 to str1 (result is stored in str1)
strcat(str1, str2);

// Print str1
printf("%s", str1);
Note that the size of str1 should be large enough to store the result of the two strings combined 
(20 in our example).

Copy Strings
To copy the value of one string to another, you can use the strcpy() function:

Example
char str1[20] = "Hello World!";
char str2[20];

// Copy str1 to str2
strcpy(str2, str1);

// Print str2
printf("%s", str2);
Note that the size of str2 should be large enough to store the copied string (20 in our example).

Compare Strings
To compare two strings, you can use the strcmp() function.

It returns 0 if the two strings are equal, otherwise a value that is not 0:

Example
char str1[] = "Hello";
char str2[] = "Hello";
char str3[] = "Hi";

// Compare str1 and str2, and print the result
printf("%d\n", strcmp(str1, str2));  // Returns 0 (the strings are equal)

// Compare str1 and str3, and print the result
printf("%d\n", strcmp(str1, str3));  // Returns -4 (the strings are not equal)
