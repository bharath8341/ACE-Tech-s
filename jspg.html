JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

The example below "finds" an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to 
"Hello JavaScript":

Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript";
JavaScript accepts both double and single quotes:

Example
document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello JavaScript';
JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values
In this example JavaScript changes the value of the src (source) attribute of an &lt;img&gt; tag:

The Light Bulb
Turn on the light  Turn off the light


JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
Changing the style of an HTML element, is a variant of changing an HTML attribute:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").style.fontSize = "35px";
JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements
Hiding HTML elements can be done by changing the display style:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "none";
JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements
Showing hidden HTML elements can also be done by changing the display style:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").style.display = "block";


The &lt;script&gt; Tag
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt; tags.

Example
&lt;script&gt;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
&lt;/script&gt;

Old JavaScript examples may use a type attribute: &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;.
The type attribute is not required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.

JavaScript Functions and Events
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.

For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks a button.

You will learn much more about functions and events in later chapters.

JavaScript in &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt;
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.

Scripts can be placed in the &lt;body&gt;, or in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page, or in both.

JavaScript in &lt;head&gt;
In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML page.

The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demo JavaScript in Head&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="demo"&gt;A Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;button type="button" onclick="myFunction()"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

JavaScript in &lt;body&gt;
In this example, a JavaScript function is placed in the &lt;body&gt; section of an HTML page.

The function is invoked (called) when a button is clicked:

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Demo JavaScript in Body&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="demo"&gt;A Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button type="button" onclick="myFunction()"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Placing scripts at the bottom of the &lt;body&gt; element improves the display speed, 
because script interpretation slows down the display.

External JavaScript
Scripts can also be placed in external files:

External file: myScript.js
function myFunction() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";
}
External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.

JavaScript files have the file extension .js.

To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a &lt;script&gt; tag:

Example
&lt;script src="myScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
You can place an external script reference in &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; as you like.

The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the &lt;script&gt; tag is located.

External scripts cannot contain &lt;script&gt; tags.

External JavaScript Advantages
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:

It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:

Example
&lt;script src="myScript1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="myScript2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
External References
An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:

With a full URL (a full web address)
With a file path (like /js/)
Without any path
This example uses a full URL to link to myScript.js:

Example
&lt;script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js:

Example
&lt;script src="/js/myScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

This example uses no path to link to myScript.js:

Example
&lt;script src="myScript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

You can read more about file paths in the chapter HTML File Paths.



JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
Using innerHTML
To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.

The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My First Paragraph&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.

Using document.write()
For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write():

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
document.write(5 + 6);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
The document.write() method should only be used for testing.



Using window.alert()
You can use an alert box to display data:

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
window.alert(5 + 6);
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
You can skip the window keyword.

In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, 
properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. 
This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional:

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
alert(5 + 6);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
Using console.log()
For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.

You will learn more about debugging in a later chapter.

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
console.log(5 + 6);
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
JavaScript Print
JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.
The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to 
print the content of the current window.

Example
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;button onclick="window.print()"&gt;Print this page&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;


JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

JavaScript Literals
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

10.50

1001
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

"John Doe"

'John Doe'


JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

let x;
x = 6;
JavaScript Operators
JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:

(5 + 6) * 10
JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:

let x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
JavaScript Expressions
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:

5 * 10
Expressions can also contain variable values:

x * 10
The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":

"John" + " " + "Doe"
JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:

let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:

var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
In these examples, using var or let will produce the same result.

You will learn more about var and let later in this tutorial.

JavaScript Comments
Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

let x = 5;   // I will be executed

// x = 6;   I will NOT be executed
You will learn more about comments in a later chapter.

JavaScript Identifiers / Names
Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.

The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.

A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)
Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Note
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

JavaScript is Case Sensitive
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:

let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.

JavaScript and Camel Case
Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Hyphens:

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

Underscore:

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

JavaScript Character Set
JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.

Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

For a closer look, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.

avaScript Comments
JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:

Example
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code:

Example
let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

Example
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
It is most common to use single line comments.
Block comments are often used for formal documentation.




Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const
In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.

They are automatically declared when first used:

Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
Note
It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

From the examples you can guess:

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
z stores the value 11
Example using var
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
Note
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.




JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement
Arithmetic Operations
A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

The two numbers can be literals:

Example
let x = 100 + 50;
or variables:

Example
let x = a + b;
or expressions:

Example
let x = (100 + 50) * a;
Operators and Operands
The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.

The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

Operand	Operator	Operand
100	+	50
ADVERTISEMENT

Adding
The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;
Subtracting
The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y;
Multiplying
The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;
Dividing
The division operator (/) divides numbers.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y;
Remainder
The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.

Example
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x % y;
In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a quotient and a remainder.

In mathematics, the result of a modulo operation is the remainder of an arithmetic division.



Example using let
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
Example using const
const x = 5;
const y = 6;
const z = x + y;
Mixed Example
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.

These are constant values and cannot be changed.

The variable total is declared with the let keyword.

The value total can be changed.

When to Use var, let, or const?
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use let if you can't use const

5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.

Just Like Algebra
Just like in algebra, variables hold values:

let x = 5;
let y = 6;
Just like in algebra, variables are used in expressions:

let z = x + y;
From the example above, you can guess that the total is calculated to be 11.

Note
Variables are containers for storing values.
JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter.
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
Note
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

The Assignment Operator
In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

x = x + 5
In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.

(It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)

Note
The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

In programming, text values are called text strings.

JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Example
const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes I am!';
Declaring a JavaScript Variable
Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

var carName;
or:
let carName;
After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).

To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:

carName = "Volvo";
You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:

let carName = "Volvo";
In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.

Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo":

Example
&lt;p id="demo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
let carName = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
&lt;/script&gt;


JavaScript has 8 Datatypes
1. String
2. Number
3. Bigint
4. Boolean
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol
8. Object

The Object Datatype
The object data type can contain:

1. An object
2. An array
3. A date

Examples
// Numbers:
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// Strings:
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "Johnson";

// Booleans
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

// Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");
Note
A JavaScript variable can hold any type of data.

The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.

To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

let x = 16 + "Volvo";
Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result?

JavaScript will treat the example above as:

let x = "16" + "Volvo";
Note
When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

Example
let x = 16 + "Volvo";
Example
let x = "Volvo" + 16;
JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:

JavaScript:
let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
Result:

20Volvo
JavaScript:
let x = "Volvo" + 16 + 4;
Result:

Volvo164
In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".

In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.

Sorting an Array
The sort() method sorts an array alphabetically:

Example
